\section*{Acknowledgments}
%After nearly 3 years of research, I am about to finish my PhD career. Looking back on these years, tons of feelings well up in my mind, among them there are content, promising, stressful, determined, and most importantly grateful feelings. I am deeply grateful for the people and things I met.\\
%First of all, I would like to thank my supervisors Marc and Ewelina. They offered me this PhD position when I needed a new start in France, and I thank them for their recognition and trust in me. During my PhD, they gave me a lot of guidance and help in my work, I learned a lot from them. Marc is a senior specialist in photogrammetry, he possesses profound experience in this domain, from which I benefited a lot. He is like a steersman, very good at controlling the direction. Ewelina is versatile, she is there for me whenever I have a problem. She is capable of many unexpected skills that surprises me, both in algorithm and operation. More importantly, both of them are rigorous scholars, they set up role models for me in my future research.
%I'd also like to thank Yann Klinger and Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris who made this PhD position possible.

%Secondly, I would like to thank my husband, Teng Wu, who is also an academic in photogrammetry. He gave me a lot of useful advises in my work. He is also a very reliable partner in life, I got countless help and support from him. Although he is not very expressive, he is fully devoted to me and our family. I know that he will support me unconditionally whenever I need him, he met all the expectations I had for a life partner.\\
%Thanks to the gift of life, we have two healthy and lovely daughters who bring joy and hope into our lives. Since having them, we have a deeper sense of responsibility and a stronger motivation to become better examples for them.\\
%Besides, I am grateful to my parents for raising me and for supporting all the choices I made in my life. Thanks to my brother, who took over the responsibility of taking care of my parents for me after I left China. As an aged PhD student, it is not easy to balance work and life, I can't imagine pursuing my PhD without the support from all the family members I mentioned before.\\
%During my research at Lastig, I met many warm-hearted friends: Manchun, Yilin, Imane, Mohamed, Arthur, Christophe, Jean-Michael, Jean-Philippe, Lanfa, Nathan, Raphael, Evelyn etc., who made my work environment full of friendliness and laughter. I am grateful to all the friends in my life who enriched me and I look forward to meeting and talking with them more often after the covid is alleviated.

%{\large\textbf{Design and Use of Numerical Anatomical Atlases for Radiotherapy\\}}
%\end{center}
%{\large\textbf{Abstract:}}
%The main objective of this thesis is to provide radio-oncology specialists with automatic tools for delineating organs at risk of a patient undergoing a radiotherapy treatment of cerebral or head and neck tumors.
%\\
%To achieve this goal, we use an anatomical atlas, i.e. a representative anatomy associated to a clinical image representing it. The registration of this atlas allows to segment automatically the patient structures and to accelerate this process. Contributions in this method are presented on three axes.
%\\
%First, we want to obtain a registration method which is as independent as possible w.r.t. the setting of its parameters. This setting, done by the clinician, indeed needs to be minimal while guaranteeing a robust result. We therefore propose registration methods allowing to better control the obtained transformation, using outlier rejection techniques or locally affine transformations.
%\\
%The second axis is dedicated to the consideration of structures associated with the presence of the tumor. These structures, not present in the atlas, indeed lead to local errors in the atlas-based segmentation. We therefore propose methods to delineate these structures and take them into account in the registration.
%\\
%Finally, we present the construction of an anatomical atlas of the head and neck region and its evaluation on a database of patients. We show in this part the feasibility of the use of an atlas for this region, as well as a simple method to evaluate the registration methods used to build an atlas.
%\\
%All this research work has been implemented in a commercial software (Imago from DOSIsoft), allowing us to validate our results in clinical conditions.

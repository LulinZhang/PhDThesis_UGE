%During the past decades, a large number of historical images are digitized, huge potential....
%lack of automatic processing pipeline, existing pipelines work well on morden images, but not good on historical images due to low radiometric quality and so on....
%
%The thesis aims at matching historical images as well as modern (i.e. digital) images taken at different times.
%The goal is accomplished with the divide and conquer strategy, which is to decompose the task of recovering robust and precise matches on inter-epoch image pairs into 2 subtasks: (1) rough co-registration focusing on robustness, and (2) precise matching focusing on accuracy.
%
%Different strategies for rough co-registration are studied.
%
%Our methods are testd for different applications.
